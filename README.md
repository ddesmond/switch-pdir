Clarisse PDIR switcher utiliy shelf buttons

This shellf button enables you to switch between PDIR and localized paths.
This will only work if the project file is actualy saved where the $PDIR is.

Install:
Copy the files where you keep your shelf buttons files (if any), if not place the zip/anywhere you want to keep them and add two shelf buttons each pointing to its scripts and icons.



This code is one-off written during a cofee drinking session. It may not be the best code but all functions have comments and it should be easily extended if needed.

I didnt want to pack a module, so instead both script are the same - the only diference being: the run mode which is set for each one differently. 
Many users dont know anyhting about paths and importing module, so this was a reasonable aproach to any user no mater the technical level.
If you have any fixes please submit a PR and ill gladly merge it.
